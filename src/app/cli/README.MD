# Command Line Interface Using Uart Communication
So I have to create a cli to communicatite board using uart for managing GPIO pins.
I decided to add another functionality to it! I added timer!
Note that for this project I only used STM32 hardware and it not ported to avr yet!

## Hardware Requirements:
1. STM32 Development Board (I used a board based on STM32F107VC)
2. STM32 Debugger & Programmer (ST-LINK or J-Link)
3. USB to Serial Adapter. (I used FT232 based board)

## Running steps:
1. **Planning**:
    I thought that it is good to have a modular project structure, so anytime it needed to add any new feature, costs be acceptable.
    Initial modules I considered:
    1. User Interaction module **CliInterface**.(I know that its a redundant word usage!)
    2. Command Interpreting module **CommandInterpreter**.
    3. GPIO interaction module **GPIOModule**.
    4. Timer interaction module **TimerModule**.
2. **CLI Usage**:
   So, after all. turn everything on. you will see a welcome message on Serial cim. window. type help all available commands will be listed.
   commands are separated by dot between sections. for example to turn gpio PortD Pin5 on just type gpio.on.d.5(ofcourse you have to set it as output pin using gpio.output.d.5 before commiting that command).
   I will complete help section so when you type help.Command the help of that command will bring up.

## Forbidden Functions:
After building my project my mentor mentioned a narrow but important point in c development for microcontrollers! There are some functions that are forbidden!!
You cand find a start point [here](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/StarlingX/Security/Banned_C_Functions). so I used [github banning header](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/banned.h) in my files to stop using these functions and guess what! I already used them. so I replaced some of them with more safer ones.

## Debugging:
So, The biggest headache for programmers: Debugging.
- Install **Cortex Debug** Extension in VSCode.
- You need **System View Description** .svd file which can be downloaded from st.com's microcontroller page. Just search for your micro name and open st.com link. Then navigate to **CAD Resources** and download the file.
- Create **launch.json** in **.vscode** folder and use my code.
- Connect microcontroller using J-Link or ST-LINK and goto Debug panel. on the upper side of panel select proper configuration and click the green play button!

Well Done!

## Static Analyzers:
I used gcc static analyzer and cppmake for analyzing my project to find hidden bugs:
- Add **-fanalyzer** to gcc compile command.
- Install **cppcheck** and use `âžœ cppcheck src -isrc/mcu/stm32/CMSIS -isrc/mcu/stm32/STM32F1xx_HAL_Driver --enable=warning,performance,portability,information,missingInclude,style,unusedFunction --std=c99` to get the result
