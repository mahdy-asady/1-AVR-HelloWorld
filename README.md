# Embedded Software Project
This is my Embedded software development learning milestone.
As I start to learn this field. with help of one of my best friends, Sajad Ghorbani, I started this project and collecting all my trainings in there.
I decided to document it for further use of anyone who wants to start embedded application development (AVR & STM32) in ubuntu using vscode!
